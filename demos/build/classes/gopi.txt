A brain–computer interface (BCI), sometimes called a mind-machine interface (MMI), direct neural interface (DNI),
synthetic telepathy interface (STI) or brain–machine interface (BMI), is a direct communication pathway between the brain 
and an external device. BCIs are often directed at assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.
Research on BCIs began in the 
1970s at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) under a grant from the National Science Foundatio
n, followed by a contract from DA
RPA.[1][2]
 The papers published after this res
 earch also mark the first appearance of the expression brain–computer interface in scientific literature.
The field of BCI research and development has since focused p
rimarily on neuroprosthetics applications that aim at restoring damaged hearing, sight and movement. Thanks to the rema
rkable cortical plasticity of the brain, signals from implanted prostheses can, after adaptation, be handled by the brain like natur
al sensor or effector channels.[3] Following years of animal experimentation, the first neuroprosthetic devices implanted in humans appear
